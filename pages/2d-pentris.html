<!-- A basic version of 2D Pentris to show the use of tetris-engine.

     This is suitable for play in VR or on desktop.
     Debug information is enabled.

     What is Pentris?  It's just like Tetris, but the shapes are made up of 5
     blocks.  It is quite a lot harder - but a good challenge for strong Tetris
     players.

     This config is almost identical to the basic 2D Tetris example.
     It just has a slightly larger arena (12 blocks rather than 10), and
     different config for the shape generator.
