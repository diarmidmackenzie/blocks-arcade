<!-- A basic version of 3D Tetris to show the use of tetris-engine.

     This is suitable for play in VR or on desktop.
     Debug information is enabled.

     This is almost identical to the setup for 2D Tetris, but I've included
     detailed comments in this file as well.

          so that's 25 blocks with a 5x5 grid - which is a lot compared to the
          10 blocks in a standard 2D Tetris line.
